The Cloud Resume Challenge (AWS)

The Cloud Resume Challenge (CRC) is a hands-on project designed to help aspiring cloud professionals and DevOps gain real-world experience by creating a fully functional resume website hosted on a cloud platform like AWS, essentially bridging the gap between having a cloud certification and applying that knowledge in a practical setting, often involving serverless technologies and basic web development skills

In summary the (CRC) will be designed using HTML and CSS and it should include a visitor counter (written in JavaScript). 
The visitor function should utilize a serverless compute action to trigger the counter to increase with each visitor and a database service to store the visitor information related to the visitor trigger. 
The serverless function will use Python to code out the visitor trigger and the visitor counter should be fronted by an API so that the database and serverless function are not being accessed directly. 
The challenge also encourages documentation and version control using GitHub, CI/CD using GitHub Actions, and testing using Python.
