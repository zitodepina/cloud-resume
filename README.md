Automated deployment of a Static Website with visitor counter on AWS using IAC (Terraform)

In this project I worked as a DevOps engineer to build and deploy a Static website with a visitor counter on AWS using Terraform.

In summary, the website will be designed using HTML and CSS. It should be deployed with a CDN and integrated with other cloud services for visitor tracking and database access.

The visitor function should utilize a serverless compute action to trigger the counter to increase with each visitor and a database service to store the visitor information related to the visitor trigger. 

The serverless function will use Python to code out the visitor trigger and the visitor counter should be fronted by an API so that the database and serverless function are not being accessed directly. 

Version control using GitHub, CI/CD using GitHub Actions, and testing using Python were also part of the project.
